Your first assignment is to use GitHub to submit some autobiographical information about yourself.  Answer the following questions.  Use GitHub to submit the resulting text file.
1. What is your name? 
	Molli Ksionsk
2. Why are you interested in Data Science? 
	I've been working with data and in analytics for 12 years and I love it. I feel like Data Science is the culmination of all I've done plus so much more. It's a fascinating field and I am excited to learn and embrace all it has to offer.
3. Tell us a little bit about your programming experience.  What programming courses have you taken?  Do you use programming on the job, and if so, how?
	I don't remember what programming courses I took (and any I did take I haven't used) but I've been programming for the past 12+ years in my various positions. I've mainly worked in SQL Studio, PL/SQL and SAS. I use all 3 on a daily basis in my current position and have begun working in R recently.
4.  Tell us a little bit about your statistics experience.  What statistics courses have you taken?  Do you use statistics on the job, and if so, how?
	My undergraduate degree was in mathematics with an actuarial emphasis. I graduated in 2002 so it's been a while since I've taken any stats courses. I was a Quantitative Analyst from 2005-2008 doing customer modeling using logistic and linear regressions. I've since risen within the organization so I don't use statistics daily but I do still use them often in analyses that I do.
5.  Do you have other experience with R or Python?
	I have a little R experience and nearly no Python experience. I've been exposed to both but am excited to learn far more.
6.  What do you hope to learn in this class?
	I want to build a foundation within R and Python. Each time I use R I like it more and more so I'm hoping I find the same to be true of Python. 
7.  Is there anything else you would like to share with us?
	Nothing in particular, just excited to get started!
